Greetings!

After 7.0-7.1 upgrade I have this issue (same thing with a new installation):

Can't change default visibility of new projects to private (http://localhost:9071/admin/projects_management) .

 When I try to do so, I get this:

Unknown url : /api/organizations/update_project_visibility



Here is a fragment of my web.log
