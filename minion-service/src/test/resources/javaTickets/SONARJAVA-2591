{"description":"Some of the SE checks interrupt the execution of the engine (NPE), or discard exploration of some branch if the CFG (condition always false). Consequently, in some cases, the order used to play the checks will have an impact on the reported issues by the debug rules.\r\n\r\nDebug rules should take that into account and be executed before others, as they have no impact on generated program states and exploration.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nclass A {\r\n  void foo() {\r\n    // condition always false on next line\r\n    if (gul()) { // should report the yields for \u0027gul\u0027\r\n      // do something\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    getNull() // Correctly report the yield\r\n    // NPE on next line\r\n      .gul(); // should report the yields for \u0027gul\u0027\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static boolean gul() {\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  static A getNull() {\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"5.0"}
