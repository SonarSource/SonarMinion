{"description":"When resource is created by method invocation, but it is not assigned to any variable, we will not raise the issue. Symbolic value is created with correct constraint, however it is not reported, because flow computation fails to find place where it was created.\r\n\r\nSee following example which creates {{FileInputStream}} in two different ways, only creation with constructor is reported.\r\n\r\nTest should also be done with JDBC signatures like {{PreparedStatement.executeQuery()}}\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nimport java.io.*;\r\nimport java.nio.file.*;\r\n\r\npublic class A {\r\n  public testFN() {\r\n    new FileInputStream(\"test\"); // Noncompliant\r\n    Files.newInputStream(Paths.get(\"test\")); // FN - issue not raised\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
