{"description":"When using cast expression with bounds, the type which is resolved should reflect the intersection of referenceType with the bounds, following what is specified by JLS: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se10/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.16 \r\n\r\nCurrently we use as symbolType only the referenceType, which leads to inconsistencies (for instance FP on RSPEC-1905, see SONARJAVA-2395).","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"5.4"}
