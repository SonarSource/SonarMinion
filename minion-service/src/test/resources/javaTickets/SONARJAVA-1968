{"description":"An inner class with its name completely obfuscated can lead to an illegalstate exception as we rely on the owner to compute the name of the .class file we are looking for. \r\n\r\nAs such if we have the symbol {{Owner$originalName}} which is obfuscated to {{obf}} then analyzer should look for {{obf.class}} but is currently looking for {{Owner.obf.class}} and end up failing on invariant.\r\n\r\nThis issue is coming from the wrong computation of the fully qualified name of the symbol when first created.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.3"}
