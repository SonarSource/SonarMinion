{"description":"source : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24365440/sonar-anonymous-inner-classes-containing-only-one-method-should-become-lambdas\n\nThe types on which this rule applies should be restricted to Single Abstract Method interfaces : \n{code}\npublic abstract class Main {\n\n    public abstract void myMethod();\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Main main \u003d new Main() {\n\n            @Override\n            public void myMethod() {\n                // TODO Auto-generated method stub\n\n            }\n        };\n        main.myMethod();\n    }\n}\n{code}\nSo this code would not raise an issue as {{Main}} is not a SAM interface.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"3.12"}
