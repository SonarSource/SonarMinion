{"description":"Currently, end of execution path nodes are stored in a HashSet which might be iterated in different order depending on the execution. In the general case this is not an issue but under some circonstances this might generates yields in different order and make an issue appear or disappear (if one yield is producing an issue but max exec step is reached before the second one is evaluated, then order of yield matters).","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.5"}
