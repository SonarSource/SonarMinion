{"description":"I have a class and a corresponding builder class. Both classes contain a number of identical fields and an equals method. \n\nAs suggested in SONAR-1760 I use SuppressWarnings(\"all\") to supress the warning about the CyclomaticComplexity. This works as expected as the CyclomaticComplexity warning is no longer shown for these classes. Strangely the duplicate code detection is not suppressed while this is expected as *all* warning should be suppressed.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
