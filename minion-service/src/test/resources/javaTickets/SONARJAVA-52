{"description":"One of my colleages told me today, that sonar complained about an undocumented public API violation. The suspect code was a public method in a private interface like:\n{code}\npublic class A {\n   private interface X {\n        public void doStuff();\n   }\n}\n{code}\nThis was used for some kind of listener, which were implemented as anonymous inner classes. Sonar considers doStuff as public API, which it isn\u0027t really, since doStuff cannot be used outside of A. \n\nI extended the unit tests and supplied changes to make public methods in private inner classes/interface not public API anymore (diff based on 2.8) ","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"2.5"}
