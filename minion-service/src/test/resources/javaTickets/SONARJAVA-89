{"description":"The interfaces and abstract methods are counted as a standard method to compute the complexity per method.\nWhen an interface is added into the project, the complexity turn down. \n\nThe complexity for abstract and interface methods is zero since the version 3.3.2.\nThe consequence is: the same method number, less general complexity. That\u0027s just accentuate the problem. \n\nInterfaces and abtract methods should be excluded from the calculation for that metric.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
