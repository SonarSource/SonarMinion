{"description":"We use Sonar through the Sonar Ant Task (Version 1.2) to analyze our Java-based Client-/Server-Software. It consists of several Java projects (modules), and we analyze all modules as a whole with Sonar, to get the \"Big Picture\".\n\nWe specify them to Sonar by giving the Ant task a list of all our Java projects including the binary, source and test folders with the means of the Ant properties \"sonar.sources\", \"sonar.binaries\" and \"sonar.tests\". \n\nThis works pretty fine, except for Jacoco (IT) Coverage (Version 0.6), it only takes accout for the first module specified in the Ant properties mentioned before. This makes it useless for us, because we want coverage results of all modules and not only for the first one.\n\nIf you need further information for tracking down this problem, please let me know. \n\nThanks in advance for your help!!\n\nBest Regards,\nReinhold\n","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
