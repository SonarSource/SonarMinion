{"description":"Constructors of a non-private inner member class have an implicit first formal parameter with type of the immediately enclosing class. This parameter is not taken into account when resolving call to default constructor of inner classes. When trying to resolve a call to a default constructor of an inner class, with semantic relying on bytecode, we are then unable to find a constructor with matching arity.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nclass A {\r\n  class Inner {\r\n    // default constructor\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n  void foo(A a) {\r\n    A.Inner inner \u003d a.new Inner(); // bytecode of A.Inner has a single default constructor with a single argument of type A\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"3.14"}
