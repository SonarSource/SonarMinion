{"description":"Currently we set {{NON_ZERO}} constraint on the result of remainder {{IREM}},{{FREM}},{{DREM}} bytecode instruction and multiplication and division bytecode instruction we set {{NON_ZERO}} if operands don\u0027t have {{ZERO}} constraint. This is not correct, because result of remainder can be zero and result of multiplication or division is {{NON_ZERO}} iff operands also have {{NON_ZERO}} constraint.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"5.0"}
