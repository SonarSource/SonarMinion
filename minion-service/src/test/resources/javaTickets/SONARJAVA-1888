{"description":"A cast expression can raise a class cast exception : the SE engine is currently ignoring that fact and thus the catch block is not visited.\r\n{code}\r\n String foo(Object object) {\r\n    try {\r\n      return (String) object; // can raise an exception\r\n    } catch (ClassCastException cce) {\r\n      return null;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n{code}\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this can only results in false negative in symbolic execution, when X-proc is introduced it can raise false positives as the yield with a null constraint on the return value won\u0027t be generated. \r\n\r\nFixing this should fix 6 false positives on BeanContextSupport.java file on the jdk6 project in ruling test.\r\n","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.3"}
