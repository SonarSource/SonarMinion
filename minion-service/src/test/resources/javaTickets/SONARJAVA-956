{"description":"Considering the following code:\n\n{code}\npublic class RunnableSonarTest implements Runnable {\n\n    public void run() {\n        System.out.println(\"Callback\");\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String args[]) {\n        try {\n        } finally {\n            System.out.println(\"First try\");\n            try {\n                System.out.println(\"Second try\");\n            } finally {\n                new RunnableSonarTest().run();     // Noncompliant\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n{code}\n\nThe expected behavior is: Analysis of the class raises issue squid:S1217 once.\nActual behavior: Analysis raises the correct issue but does so multiple times. For this simple class (two nested try-finallys), it appears two times.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"3.1"}
