{"description":"Construction of classpath will ignore files that are not jar/zip/aar files.\r\nThis might lead to the fail of the analysis when constructing the classpath as any other file ( .so file for JNI for instance) will be ignored and wrongly reported as non exisiting.\r\n\r\nWe should still validate that file exists but not fail when a file is ignored from classpath (log at debug level that file has been ignored maybe ?)
