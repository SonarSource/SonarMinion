{"description":"{code}\nenum A{\nA;\npublic boolean equals(int value) {return true;}\n}\n{code}\nAn issue is raised. \nHowever as specified in JLS : http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.9.1 {{equals}} method is final in {{Enum}} class and {{hashcode}} method as well. \n\nTherefore it makes no sense to run this check on enums.\n","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"2.5"}
