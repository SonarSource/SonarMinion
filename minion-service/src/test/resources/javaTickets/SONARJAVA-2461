{"description":"When encoutering a jump instruction which referenced label has already been created the current block of CFG won\u0027t have its true successor set.\r\nThis results in a null pointer exception (NPE) when symbolically executing this CFG while computing method behavior. \r\n\r\nAs this mechanism is only used for a limited set of methods : this problem is revealed by usage of apache-commons-lang 2.1 which has a different set of instructions than more recent versions of this library.
