{"description":"java.security.Principal is a SAM interface declaring equals/hashcode methods. \r\n\r\nWhen resolving type of lambda in the following {{Principal p \u003d () -\u003e \"foo\";}} \r\nwe look up the SAmethod and wrongly pick up the equals method to look up the signature. This lead to failure in semantic analysis as there is a different arity than expected.\r\n\r\nAs per JLS 8 9.8 [emphasis added]: \r\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.8\r\n\r\n{quote}A functional interface is an interface that has just one abstract method *(aside from the methods of Object)*{quote}","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.4"}
