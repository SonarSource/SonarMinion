{"description":"When specifying {{sonar.java.libraries\u003dlib/***/**.jar}}, we should select all the jars from the {{lib}} folder, including the jars from all its sub-folders.\r\n\r\nHaving the following library structure, we should cosnequently get {{myJar1.jar}} and {{myJar2.jar}}, but we currently select only {{myJar2.jar}}, ignoring the jar in the {{lib}} root folder.\r\n\r\nThis behavior was working properly in version {{4.1}} (regression).\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nlib/\r\n  myJar1.jar\r\n  myFolder/\r\n    myJar2.jar\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nNote: a possible temporary workaround is to use {{lib/**.jar}}, but it somehow ignore the fact that ** should be used to match zero or more _directory_ elements, and hierarchy of files.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.4"}
