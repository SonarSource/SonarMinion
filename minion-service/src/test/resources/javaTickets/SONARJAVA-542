{"description":"From the mailing list : \n{quote} This is only a small issue. But it confused me when Jenkins said:\nJaCoCo IT report not found.\nJaCoCo reports not found.\n\n\"IT report not found\" is OK, because I don\u0027t have any integration tests. But that JaCoCo reports are reported as not found when they are later analyzed is strange. Unfortunately, there\u0027s no indication that these messages are only for the JaCoCoOverallSensor.\n{quote}","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"2.3"}
