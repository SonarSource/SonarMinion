{"description":"Currently parser not able to parse:\n{noformat}\npublic class Example extends Base {\n  \u003cT\u003e T parse() {\n    return super.\u003cT\u003eparse(); // parse error\n  }\n}\n\nclass Base {\n  \u003cT\u003e T parse() {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n{noformat}\nSeems that this case is missed in grammar at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-18.html , but it is presented in grammar at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.12.\n\nUnit tests for grammar must be improved - currently there is a lack of tests for part of grammar for \"expressions\" (exactly where problem located) and maybe for some other parts.\n\nAlso can be noted that PMD 4.3 can not parse such code too.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"1.5"}
