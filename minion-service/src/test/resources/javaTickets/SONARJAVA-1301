{"description":"If you have a package cycle pac1.Class1 -\u003e pac2.Class2 -\u003e pac3.Class3 -\u003e pac1.Class1 with the same weight on all dependency then the feedback edge returned by the IncrementalCyclesAndFESSolver will change between each analysis. It was easily reproduced with JDK 7 but not with JDK 8. Some user reported the same issue with JDK 8 so this should be very implementation dependenct.\nSomething in the algorithm should rely on a random order (HasMap / HashSet). We could fix this by explicitely specifing what should be the result (first dependency after sorting components by name or something like that).\n\nThe main issue is that the rule \"Avoid cycle between java package\" will \"move\" between each analysis from one file to another. So if the rule was closed as FP or WF then it may reappear during next analysis.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
