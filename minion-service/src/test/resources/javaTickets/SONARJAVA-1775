{"description":"When reading method type from bytecode:  thrown exceptions might not be generated in method signature if they do not involve type parameters as specified in the jls : \r\n\r\nbq. If the throws clause of a method or constructor does not involve type variables, the ThowsSignature may be elided from the MethodTypeSignature.\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation this means that we might end up with a method type not throwing anything because the parsing of the signature erase what we\u0027ve learn before. \r\n\r\n\r\n","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.1"}
