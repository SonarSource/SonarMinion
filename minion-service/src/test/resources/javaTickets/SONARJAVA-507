{"description":"Currently code like (see reproducer in attachment)\n{code}\npublic enum SizeUnit {\n  BYTES {\n    ...\n  }\n}\n{code}\ncan generate issue with message like \"Reduce this anonymous class number of lines from 21 to at most 20, or make it a named class.\", which is clearly false-positive, because enum constants cannot be unnamed. For me this looks like a regression after SONARJAVA-454.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"2.3"}
