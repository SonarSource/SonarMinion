{"description":"Currently for a file from directory \"org/Example.java\":\n{noformat}\nclass Example {}\n{noformat}\npackage \"org\" will be used (see SONAR-2348 and SONAR-864), which results in incorrect metric \"packages\", when file in another directory (let\u0027s say \"com/Example.java\") also belongs to unnamed package.\n\nMoreover - exception will be thrown, when package name doesn\u0027t match package declaration. This exception should be removed for SONARJAVA-438.\n\nTo be discussed - whether should we continue to compute metric \"packages\" for directories or not? The problem is that several directories could contain same package or even one directory several packages.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"2.1"}
