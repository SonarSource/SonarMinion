{"description":"Current message \"Exception is thrown\" is added whenever there is exceptional symbolic value on top of the stack. This should be theoretically sufficient, however we don\u0027t keep stack of program state in always consistent state (see SONARJAVA-2458), so flow message should only be added when exploded graph node is method invocation or division by zero, thus avoiding the problem of inconsistent stack.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.14"}
