{"description":"When reading array types from byte code, dimensions are ignored and an array of a single dimension is created.\r\n\r\nConsequently, when reading the following code from bytecode, we will build a class with a single field of type Object[] instead of type Object[][].\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nclass A {\r\n  Object[][] field;\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nCause: {{asmType.dimensions()}} is never checked when creating the array type, and the {{asm.ElementType()}} is {{Ljava/lang/Object;}}. So dimensions are not created recursively.\r\n\r\nSee code: https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-java/blob/4.2.1.6971/java-frontend/src/main/java/org/sonar/java/resolve/BytecodeVisitor.java#L274","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.4"}
