{"description":"In the construction of the squid index, Enum constant are not handled properly resulting in the fact that some methods have the same keys and thus are ignored/replace in the squid Index. \nThis impact computation of complexity for java source files using declaration of body of Enum Constants.\n\nFor example : \n\n{code}\nclass A{\n enum B {\n  C{\n    void foo(){}\n  },\n  D{\n    void foo(){}\n  };\n  void foo(){}\n }\nvoid method(){}\n}\n{code}\n\nIn this case, metric for method is expected to be 4 but it will be counted as 2 as foo method will only be one time in SquidIndex as all methods will have the same keys.
