{"description":"When a yield does not interact with a symbolic value that we are tracking for reporting, its flow should not be computed. \r\n\r\nSince version 4.6 and due to SONARJAVA-1996 and SONARJAVA-2034 those flows are computed. While this does not change the resulting flow (as they will have no impact on it), this becomes a performance hotspot when call graph within a file is big as a lot of unecessary computation is done.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.8"}
