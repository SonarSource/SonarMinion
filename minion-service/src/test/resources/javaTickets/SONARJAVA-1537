{"description":"From https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html\r\n{quote}\r\nRequiring that Assertions are Enabled\r\nProgrammers of certain critical systems might wish to ensure that assertions are not disabled in the field. The following static initialization idiom prevents a class from being initialized if its assertions have been disabled:\r\n\r\n static {\r\n  boolean assertsEnabled \u003d false;\r\n  assert assertsEnabled \u003d true; // Intentional side effect!!!\r\n  if (!assertsEnabled)\r\nthrow new RuntimeException(\"Asserts must be enabled!!!\");\r\n } \r\n\r\n{quote}\r\n\r\nTherefore, the cfg should support those cases or all cases but all should be done to avoid generating on issues with such patterns\r\n","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.5"}
