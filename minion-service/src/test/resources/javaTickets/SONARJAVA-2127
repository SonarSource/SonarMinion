{"description":"Example with the NotSymbolicValue:\r\n\r\nAssuming that the following method generates method yields with all the combinations of {{TRUE}} and {{FALSE}}.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nstatic void foo(boolean a, boolean b) {\r\n  // do something\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThe matching of method yield will be erroneous when calling {{foo}} with the following configuration:\r\n{code}\r\nvoid bar(boolean b) {\r\n  if (b) {\r\n    foo(b, !b);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWe would expect to match only the yield which have {{TRUE}} and {{FALSE}} as constraints, but when getting the constraint for the second parameter, the programState returns {{null}}. Consequently, second constraint is ignored and all the yields having {{TRUE}} for the first constraint will be used.","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
