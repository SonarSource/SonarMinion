{"description":"When semantic analysis verify if a type is a subtype of another, the whole hierarchy is checked instead of only the direct supertypes. This leads to a lot of superfluous operation that can cause performance issue on edge cases. \r\nTwo improvements can be  made to improve the performance : only rely on direct super types for lookup of subtyping and cache the computation of supertypes as it can be triggered many times.\r\n","component":"SonarJava","component_version":"4.7"}
