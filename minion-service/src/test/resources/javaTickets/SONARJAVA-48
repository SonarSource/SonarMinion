{"description":"When defining a basedir in my ant file and using jacoco agent integrated in sonar, jacoco agent stores its data in the current folder/target/jacoco.exec while jacoco sensor is looking at ${basedir}/target/jacoco.exec.\n\nThe workaround that I found is to define a property sonar.jacoco.itReportPath and set it to currentdir/target/jacoco.exec.\n\nIt could be good for both agent and sensor to be looking at the same path, maybe .sonar/target/jacoco.exec","component":"SonarJava","component_version":""}
