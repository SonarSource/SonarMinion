{"description": "Hello SonarSource support team,\r\n\r\nOur team ECU Tooling reported a problem after they have moved a module from one project to another.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time a module move has been done with SonarQube 6.7. Similar module moves done while using SonarQube 5.6 could be resolved without any problem by updating the key of the moved module in the source project to an unused key (e.g. by adding _moved_to_destination to the module key). (If it is unclear what we do please also check SUPPORT-5666 where we ask if SonarQube 6.x will support automatic module move and describe what we do in more detail.)\r\n\r\nWhile moving a module from a source project to a destination project we observe an error reported by the compute engine for the destination project, which is expected:\r\n\r\nError Details: ecl_bsw_config_base-MAIN [Project Analysis]\r\nError Details\r\n\r\nValidation of project failed:\r\n  o Module \"com.xxx.components:com.xxx.build.core.common.junit.tests\" is already part of project \"com.xxx.components:com.xxx.ubk.bct.processing.tycho\"\r\n  o Module \"com.xxx.components:com.xxx.build.core.common\" is already part of project \"com.xxx.components:com.xxx.ubk.bct.processing.tycho\"\r\nNow the problem is that the module keys com.xxx.components:com.xxx.build.core.common.junit.tests and com.xxx.components:com.xxx.build.core.common which are supposed to be part of the source project com.xxx.components:com.xxx.ubk.bct.processing.tycho are not shown on the update keys page of the source project (project homepage > Administration > Update Key). Therefore we cannot update the key in the source project and cannot resolve the problem.\r\n\r\nAttached please find the component tree of the source project created with Web API api\/components\/tree which does not show the conflicting module keys.\r\n\r\nHow can we fix this?\r\n\r\nThank you for your support!",
