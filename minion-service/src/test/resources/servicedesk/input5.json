{"description": "Hello SonarSource support team,\r\n\r\nToday I would like to report that from time to time we find log entries in sonar.log like the following:\r\n\r\nTwo methods with same method signature but not providing classes assignable? \"public abstract boolean java.util.List.isEmpty()\" and \"public boolean java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableCollection.isEmpty()\" please report!\r\nBy chance I came across that these log entries are related to permission template editing. They seem to appear whenever the internal Web APIs api\/permissions\/template_users and api\/permissions\/template_groups are called. I used a test installation of SonarQube 6.7.3 to created the attached screencast as there is no background noise in the logs. Since the same problem occurs on our pilot system, the support info added is from the pilot system.\r\n\r\nSorry for the stuttering when I tried to show the Web API. The small screen caused wrapping so I just didn't see the obvious for some reason. \r\n\r\nHope you can help to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
