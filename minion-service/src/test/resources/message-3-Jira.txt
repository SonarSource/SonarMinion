{"description": "Dear SonarSource Support,  I have the question regarding the sonarqube scanner for msbuild.  SonarQube Version 5.6 SonarQube plugin for TFS ver 2.0.0. C# SonarQube plugin ver 5.9.0.1001.  We've tried to use SonarQube plugin withing our Team Foundation Server. But after the execution we are getting following error message:  step: Fetch quality profile from SonarQube :  2018-01-11T09:52:41.3511383Z ##[error]The C# plugin installed on the SonarQube server is not compatible with the SonarQube analysis agent (i.e. the MSBuild.SonarQube.Runner.exe, or the build automation task). Either check the compatibility matrix or get the latest versions for both.  2018-01-11T09:52:41.3511383Z ##[error]Pre-processing failed. Exit code: 1 2018-01-11T09:52:41.4657263Z ##[error]Unexpected exit code received from batch file: 1 The question is : does the problem of incompatibility comes from the C# plugin, or from TFS plugin? or we can update somehow Msbuild version to make this running without updating C# plugin yet ?  Thank you very much in advance for the answer. thank you  best regards", "component": "
