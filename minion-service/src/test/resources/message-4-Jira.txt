{"description": "Hello,  we experienced a OutOfMemory error in some of our analyses tonight:  Error Details: aa-versorger [Project Analysis] Error Details java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded 	at java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(Array.java:75) 	at oracle.jdbc.driver.BufferCache.get(BufferCache.java:231) ..... The builds over the last days were fine and had no such issues. Our settings for the ComputeEngine are:  sonar.ce.javaOpts=-Xmx1024m -Xms128m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true It is easy to make them higher, however I would like to ask if it is recommended or some steps had to be taken before that?  Another thing happened with our nightly builds (perhaps it is related?). The analyses projects took much more time than usual. I have attached a file samCE.log which shows the analyses for one of our biggest projects. The usual analysis time is ~300.000ms, however this night it took ~2.264.000 ms until the analysis was finished.  Regards", "component": "
